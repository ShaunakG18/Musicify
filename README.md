# 🎧 Musicify – My Personal Music Player

**Musicify** is a custom-built, offline music player created for my personal use. It plays `.mp3` files from a local folder and has a simple UI with song buttons, visuals, and a favorites-style experience. Built using Python and CustomTkinter, this project helped me explore GUI design and media handling.

> 🎓 Created while I was in Class 12 to enjoy music for free from my own local collection.

## 🎵 Add Your Own Songs

You can personalize Musicify by adding your own `.mp3` files:

1. Put your songs inside the `allsongs/` folder
2. (Optional) Modify the code to create buttons for those songs
3. Restart the app and click to play

✅ You don’t need to recompile — the app uses files directly from the folder.
